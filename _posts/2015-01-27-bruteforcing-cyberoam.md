GoComicDownloader is a python script that downloads new comics which are added daily to the website [GoComic]

## Running the script

## Conclusion

Our College uses Cyberoam. They control and monitor what we see and what we do not on the Internet. They give us a very very crappy speed for a Computer Science College. They block even the most harmless sites like [IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/).

The least they can do is to add some security. I am tired of hearing my other friends praising their college’s internet speed, saying how they can download a movie in minutes , where as I can’t even download online lectures without exceeding my limited quota.
