This post is regarding critical vulnerability i found on directi's codechef.com


## Proof of Concept

Earlier,I have reported a critical vulnerability(directory traversal) in the main domain(codechef.com).This time I thought of looking into the subdomains of codechef.com.<br/>
Through subdomain bruteforcing one domain caught my attention https://mail.codechef.com. <br/>
So,started looking for some juicy stuffs through dir-buster. <br/>
Got 200ok response from info.php file.<br/>
OWASP-A6 (https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-A6-Sensitive_Data_Exposure) <br/>

## SQL-INJECTION(CRITICAL) <br/>
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SQL_Injection
Through some googling, I found that mail.codechef.com was using sendy email newsletter application.<br/>
Two vulnerabilities were available publicly through exploit database of sql-injection.Here is the screenshot-</br>
Url-https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/31898 <br/>
![Here is the screenshot:]({{ site.url }}/public/blog/s14.png)
mail.codechef.com is using a vulnerable version  of sendy.<br/>
![Here is the screenshot:]({{ site.url }}/public/blog/s14.png)

Url->https://mail.codechef.com/app?i= [vulnerable-sql-injection-point] <br/>
Sqlmap confirms the sql-injection.This is a critical vulnerability which can compromise the server.
Fix-Upgrade to the latest version <br/>
